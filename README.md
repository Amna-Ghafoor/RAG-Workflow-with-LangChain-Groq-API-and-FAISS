# RAG Workflow with LangChain, Groq API, and FAISS

In this assignment, you will:

1. Load web content using LangChain.
2. Store embeddings of the content in FAISS, a vector database.
3. Use Groq API as your LLM to query the stored embeddings via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## Objectives:

- Learn how to use LangChain for data loading from the web.
- Understand embeddings and how to store/retrieve them with FAISS.
- Implement RAG workflow using Groq LLM API.
